                        <p class="project-description read-more-focus" data-focus-title="RollRota" data-focus-char-limit="800">
                            RollRota is a scheduling web app tailored for DnD and tabletop players. I created both the back-end and front-end for this app using ASP.NET Core and the bundled razor syntax for rendering clientside content.
                            <br><br>
                            I chose to create this app without using any front-end JS frameworks such as Angular/React in order to both improve my vanilla JS understanding and to also gain an appreciation of why frameworks are so widely used, and what they aim to accomplish.
                            <br><br>
                            For data modelling and storage I used EF Core with an SQL db, I took a code-first approach for this app which felt very intuitive and was easy to manange throughout development.
                            <br><br>
                            I used numerous JS/.NET libraries to help build this app, the most complex being Hangfire, a background task manager that helped automate email reminders and other internal functionalities.
                            <br><br>
                            The app is hosted on Azure as an app service alongside the SQL server, I also created a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> bot using C#/.NET that directly integrates with the RollRota web app, this is deployed as a web job on top of the core app service. The bot allows users to vote on date/time proposals and receieve automatic message updates in their channels.
                            <br><br>
                            There were lots of challenges in creating this app, the biggest of all was probably dealing with EF Core caching for databases that had simulatanious connections (Hangfire, RollRota, Discord bot). Another was dealing with the lack of data-binding between the Razor rendered HTML and the corresponding JS files, this was a huge eye-opener as to why front-end JS frameworks are simply necessary in large-scale projects that involve a lot of data.

                            Actor Lookup is a two-step movie/tv-show/game search engine that provides a list of auto-completed character names, from which you can quickly find out the corresponding actor. This was created as a fast, auto-completed, spoiler-free alternative to IMDB. 
                            <br><br>
                            This app was created using Angular for the front-end and ASP.NET Core MVC API for the backend. I used an Elasticsearch server as the base of the search engine, the data used in Elasticsearch was provided by IMDB in the form of several csv/json files which were imported into the server.

                            During development, I used a Elasticsearch docker image for testing but during deployment I used an official cloud hosting service in it's place for pricing reasons.

                        <p class="project-description read-more-focus" data-focus-title="Youtube Jukebox" data-focus-char-limit="800">
                            Youtube Jukebox is a client-server application that allows clients to listen to Youtube videos (audio) in sync. This app is composed of two parts, the server (host) and the connected client(s).
                            <br><br>
                            The client utilises an open-source .NET audio library called NAudio, this library provides a ton of really useful wrappers for Microsoft/Windows audio APIs, it also includes tools that read and assembly MP3 frames from raw bytes, which is how the server sends audio data to the clients. The GUI is built using WPF, it was relatively simple in design so I chose not to implement the logic using the MVVM pattern, perhaps if the project was larger in scope I would have chose to go down that route.
                            <br><br>
                            The server is a console application which communicates to all the connected clients via TCP, I used the .NET Winsock wrapper classes to facilitate TCP connections, I then handled the actual data buffer using the serializer/message encapsulation library I made previously, ProjjSerializer. The server handles URl/search requests using a third-party Youtube library (Youtube Explode) which allows the server to download metadata/audio from video Ids, or retrieve results from search queries. As Youtube doesn't have an official API for searching/download, this library is reliant on web scraping, this is definitely a short-coming in the app's design but also unavoidable until an official API is released.
                            <br><br>
                            Both the client app and server write and read to external configuration files, the client also has the ability to create and load playlists. The most difficult part of developing this app was researching and understanding certain audio technologies (i.e. MP3 frames) and also keeping the audio buffer/playback in sync across all clients.

                            DRY Detective was an exprimental project I made whilst learning Roslyn API (aka .NET Compiler Platform). The aim of the tool was to detect blocks of statements that violate the DRY (Don't repeat yourself) programming principle. The tool identifies groups of statements that have the same syntaxual 'signature' and attempts to refactor them into a new method definition, replacing the DRY violating statements with the new method call.

                            In terms of specific functionality, the analyser attempts to seperate consts and local/global variables so that it can define the correct parameters in the new method, it achieves this by analysing the data flow in and out of the containing blocks (pre-refactorization). The tool is also capable of handling ref/in/out paramaters and auto-creating delegates that match existing method-calls if needed.

                            This tool was really fun to make but ultimately the idea was flawed, it became increasingly difficult to detect certain scenarios where DRY violations would appear and it also had considerable performance concerns as each case had to be considered. I'm still really happy to have achieved what I created, it gave me some real insight into how C# is compiled and how the syntax and semantics of the code is validated.

                            ProjjSerializer is a binary serialization .NET library that will automatically serialize any type without the need for custom attributes. The library is formed by two parts, the core serializer class TypeSerializer and the wrapper class ProjjSerializer which also handles writing and reading buffers, partial buffer reading and implementing message headers.
                            <br><br>
                            I created this library whilst learning about network programming for .NET, I noticed that transferring complex data types across the network was not particularly straight-forward, so I wanted to create a library that would allow me to simply bind a data type to a callback so I could quickly add new data types whenever I wanted.
                            <br><br>
                            I achieved this with the use of reflection, registering types, mapping their class members recursively and then using that map to reconstruct types later on when receiving data. There were a few challenges when creating this library, such as ensuring that reference types were only serialized once and avoiding circular dependencies when traversing deep structures. There were lots of minor hiccups too, like abstract types, read-only fields and other uncommon field modifiers. Fortunately, I was able to overcome these hurdles in the end. This library's performance pales in comparison to popular serialization libaries (it isn't the slowest though!), but it does support advanced data types with deep/complicated structures, which typically is not possible with standard JSON/XML serializers without first implementing the respective methods.

                            I created numerous mods for the popular game Valheim, these mods were created using .NET (Mono) and a great library called Harmony that allows you to patch .NET assemblies/methods during runtime.
                            <br><br>
                            Harmony patching is composed of different patch types, such as prefixes and postfixes, this means to create a method that is executed before the original method or after the original method, respectively. These patches also allow specific injections as parameters, such as the original class instance, the original arguments and much more.
                            <br><br>
                            My previous knowledge of Unity3D allowed me to make some pretty specific and unique mods, such as player-to-player trading and an entire new camera/combat targeting system for the game. Creating these mods was especially fun because having the game as base to experiment with meant that the ideas were limitless. Creating mods for existing games is unique because there is already an existing player-base, I received thousands of downloads and tons of feedback on the mods, which was really rewarding and not really something I had experienced with other projects.

                            This was a game I was developing with my two brothers, the core gameplay was similar to that of Prop Hunt, in which there are two teams: Props (everyday objects) must run and hide from the other team who is trying to find and destroy them.
                            <br><br>
                            I made this game using Unity3D and a high-level networking API for Unity called Mirror. This was the first and only multiplayer game I attempted to create using Unity, the project itself sadly was never finished due to design/timing issues but I still learned a great deal while developing it.
                            <br><br>
                            I was responsible for the entire codebase in this game, it's probably one of the biggest projects I've created to this day as it was composed of a couple hundred classes. I created the base game itself, which was split between the game servers and client-side code, for each entity in the game I had to create both client-side and server-side logic. The game server was state driven and handled things such as controlling gamemode phases, player connections, spawning of entities across all clients, closing connections and even anti-cheat precautions. The client-side code was dedicated to things such as player camera, player movement and actions, managing the local connection to the server, game options and much, much more.
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond the core game iteslf, I also designed and created a map editor for the game, which would allow players to create and design maps and then play them online with others. The tool was able to create maps using a grid-placement system and had multiple key-binding for rotating, scaling and changing objects, I utilised the Command pattern to allow undo/redo functionalities as well. The maps could then be exported as a string and played with other players when hosting a match.
                            <br><br>
                            Aside from the game servers, I also created a Master game server (with the help of message server named Insight), this handled player matchmaking and the creation of game server instances when required.
                            <br><br>
                            As an expriment, during the later stages of development I created a (fairly basic) AI system for both teams in the game, these essentially behaved like bots that carried out similar actions to players. The motivation behind this was to have some sort of bot auto-fill system should the game not be filled with an equal amount of players. The bots were simple in design, they were state-machine driven and carried out tasks such as patrolling areas, chasing enemies and collecting objectives.
                            <br><br>
                            It's a shame that this project could never be released, despite the core functionality/game loop being fairly sound, there were several scope/design issues that we failed to predict and sadly that meant our motiviation for finishing it diminished over time.

                            This was a game I created for Android/IOS, it's a simple 2.5D puzzle game where you touch the screen to flip the dungeon, the goal of the game is to guide all the slimes to the portals while avoiding the spikes, the slimes are not player controlled and simply move forward so the challenge is knowing when and where to flip the dungeon in order to collect the gems and ultimately complete the level.
                            <br><br>
                            The game consists of 25 levels in total, most of the game's visuals and sound effects were royalty-free assets from the Unity store. This was the first Unity game I ever published, I'm proud of how polished it looks considering the amount of time spent on the project, the game performs well on most devices but if I were to re-create it today I would probably do a lot of things differently.
